# Sentiment Analysis for Covid-19 Vaccination using Twitter Data

# Abstract

There is an abundance of data online on social media platforms discussing the coronavirus disease
of 2019 (COVID-19). Given the vast amount of data, it is infeasible for a human to process this
manually to obtain an understanding of peopleâ€™s opinions about the pandemic. Furthermore, there
is a large amount of rumoured data discussed online providing incorrect information to those reading
it. This study investigates how one-dimensional convolutional neural networks can be applied to the
problem of COVID-19 rumour detection. The learning word embedding (Word2Vec) and pre-trained
word embedding (GloVe) models are explored to compare their performance on the text classification of
COVID-19 sentiment analysis. The pre-trained word embedding achieved an accuracy of 99.41% similar
to the learning word embedding that obtained an accuracy of 99.31%. Since the difference in their
performance is not significant, it implies that similar performance can be achieved using a pre-trained
model with different trainable parameters between the learning embedding and the pre-trained word
embeddings, which is required to achieve the same results. Finally, the model can be applied to social
media data posted from various groups of countries to determine how much rumoured data is being
discussed online.
